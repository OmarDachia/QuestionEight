Circumference of a Circle

In Mathematics, the circumference of any shape defines the path or the boundary that surrounds the shape. In other words, the circumference is also called the perimeter, which helps to identify the length of the outline of any shape. As we know, the perimeter and area of circle are the two important parameters of a circle. In this article, we will discuss the “Circumference of a circle” or “Perimeter of circle” with its definition, formula, methods to find the circle’s circumference with many solved examples.

Circle’s Circumference
Circumference of the circle or perimeter of the circle is the measurement of the boundary of the circle. Whereas the area of circle defines the region occupied by it.  If we open a circle and make a straight line out of it, then its length is the circumference. It is usually measured in units, such as cm or unit m.

When we use the formula to calculate the circumference of the circle, then the radius of the circle is taken into account. Hence, we need to know the value of the radius or the diameter to evaluate the perimeter of the circle.

Circumference of a Circle Formula
The Circumference (or) perimeter of circle = 2πR

where,

R is the radius of the circle

π is the mathematical constant with an approximate (up to two decimal points) value of 3.14

Again,

Pi (π) is a special mathematical constant; it is the ratio of circumference to diameter of any circle.

where C = π D

C is the circumference of the circle

D is the diameter of the circle

For example: If the radius of the circle is 4cm then find its circumference.

Given: Radius = 4cm

Circumference = 2πr

= 2 x 3.14 x 4

= 25.12 cm
